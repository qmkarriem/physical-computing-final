## Project: SynthBall
### Conceptual Description
We’ve created two devices that each incorporate inertial sensors to transmit data about their individual movement in real time; specifically, elastic/silicon balls that can be thrown, caught, rolled and bounced. The devices possess their own type of temporality, where human gestures performed while in contact with them are automatically recorded, and used to inform and manipulate the datastream as it unfolds in real time, thus acting as a type of mnemonic device of gesture. The data transmitted will include three dimensional accelerometer data, a gyroscope to measure changes in rotational orientation, a magnetometer to measure gravitational fields (like the Earth’s). The data will be streamed to media software to control aspects of audio and visuals in real-time. 

### Form
Our goal was to remediate physical motion, performance and play from material bodies and objects to abstract digital imagery and sound. In using motion capture (or, more accurately “motion streaming”) to create non-representational transformations, we’re interested in exploring whether elements of gesture or temporal meaning can be dissociated from human form. We’ve chosen the spherical form factor because it is ancient and universally associated with physical play; we share an interest in constructing virtual play spaces that augment and inform, rather than replace, physical experiences as a challenge to the wholly digitized perceptual systems seen in virtual reality products. The objects could be further used to model and manipulate social dynamics. How might they reconfigure the ways that people with in a space act together and alone?

**Finished Enclosure**
The finished enclosure was created through a silicone moulding process. We first designed and printed a 3D mold. We used a household silicone that we treated with glycerin to expedite the drying process. The components were placed in plastic for security and embedded inside the mold while it was still plyable.

### Technical Details
Hardware Used:
* Particle Photon 
* IMU Sensors and shield 
* Sparkfun battery shield
* Silicone and 3d printed mold

**Other Materials**
* Rubberbands
* Ziplock Bags
* Dishwashing Liquid (Blue)
* Water

### End Goal:
We anticipate uses of this project in live performances, installations and participatory game-based encounters with observers. The objects themselves are being created as part of our coursework in this semester’s Physical Computing course, and similar devices (wearable versions rather than the ball form here) and software will be used in a new dance work that will debut at MoogFest in Spring 2018. 

Our reach goal for this semester was to have 4 device prototypes fabricated for testing, with custom designed PCBs and range finding capabilities. The "feasible goal" we set was to have at least 2 fabricated and functioning. We met the latter goal, but were not able to fabricate custom PCBs, implement rangefinding, or create a set of 4 devices. We've been encouraged by faculty to submit the devices to Duke I&E for patenting and potential funding for future development.
